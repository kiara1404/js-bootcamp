## **Arrays & Objects**
An array stores multiple items in one variable:

           var animals = ["cats", "dogs", "rabbits", "cows"]; 



An object:
* you can store different datatypes in one object.

         var myCat = {
          "name": "Cookie",
          "color": "Black",
          "age": 4,
          "friends": ["Cleo","Momo"]      
          };

You can do a lot with objects. Here are some that I found interesting:
* adding a property: 

        myCat.sex = "male";

* delete property:

       delete myCat.age;
