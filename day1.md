## **ES5 vs. ES6**
In ES5 the only way to declare a variable is with var. With ES6 you can declare variables with _var_, _let_ and _const_.

var = globally scoped or function scoped. This entails that when the variable is globally declared you can use the variable through your entire code. Function scoped means that you can only use the variable within your function.

let = block scoped. (everything between {}) Let can be updated as long you'll use it in different scopes.

const = block scoped. Const declarations can't be updated or redefined.
